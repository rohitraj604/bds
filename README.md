# Birthday Surprise Project

Simple React + Vite project with React Router.

Features:
- Landing page asking to see the surprise
- Surprise page with:
  - Lights on/off (dark -> pink)
  - Play Music (tiny WebAudio synth)
  - Decorate (confetti burst with adjustable delay)
  - Fly the balloons
  - Cut the cake and light candles
  - Typed name: "Trapti"
  - Share / copy link button

How to run:
1. Install: `npm install`
2. Dev: `npm run dev`
3. Build: `npm run build`

This project is intentionally minimal; you can replace the tiny synth with an MP3 and enhance visuals later.
